# ðŸ’¯ Stats Configuration

**File:** `config.toml`

> **Note:** Enabling package manager, weather, and GPU stats will increase Catnapâ€™s execution time.
> Catnap **cannot** speed up these stats:
>
> * **Package manager** speed depends on your distroâ€™s package manager.
> * **Weather** speed depends on your internet connection and the response time of [wttr.in](https://github.com/chubin/wttr.in).

## Changing Icons

You can customize the icon for any stat in the `[stats]` section:

```toml
username = {icon = ">", name = "user", color = "(RD)"}
```

Here, the default icon for the `username` stat was changed to `>`.

---

## Renaming Stats

To rename a stat, just manupulate the `name` field:

```toml
username = {icon = ">", name = "username", color = "(RD)"}
```

Now the `username` stat will be displayed as **"username"** instead of its default name.

---

## Changing Colors

To change a statâ€™s display color, modify the `color` value:

```toml
username = {icon = ">", name = "user", color = "{YW}"}
```

This will display the `username` stat in **bright yellow**.

---

## Enabling or Disabling Stats

To hide a stat, simply comment out its line:

```toml
uptime = {icon = ">", name = "uptime", color = "(BE)"}
# distro = {icon = ">", name = "distro", color = "(GN)"}
```

Here, `uptime` is shown, while `distro` is hidden.

---

## Adjusting Stat Order

The display order is based on the order in the config file.
Example:

**Order:** CPU â†’ Distro â†’ Uptime

```toml
cpu    = {icon = ">", name = "cpu", color = "(RD)"}
distro = {icon = ">", name = "distro", color = "(GN)"}
uptime = {icon = ">", name = "uptime", color = "(BE)"}
```

**Order:** Uptime â†’ CPU â†’ Distro

```toml
uptime = {icon = ">", name = "uptime", color = "(BE)"}
cpu    = {icon = ">", name = "cpu", color = "(RD)"}
distro = {icon = ">", name = "distro", color = "(GN)"}
```

---

## Adding Separators

Separators create horizontal dividers in the stats block.

Example layout:

```txt
â•­â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â•®
â”‚ > user     â”‚
â”‚ > hname    â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¤  <-- Separator 1
â”‚ > uptime   â”‚
â”‚ > distro   â”‚
â”‚ > kernel   â”‚
â”‚ > desktp   â”‚
â”‚ > term     â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¤  <-- Separator 2
â”‚ > shell    â”‚
â”‚ > packages â”‚
â•°â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â•¯
```

To add a separator:

```toml
sep_[name] = "Any text here (value not used by Catnap)"
```

You can add as many as you like.

---

## Disk Stats

Disk stats use the `disk_` prefix followed by an index number:

```toml
disk_[index] = {icon = ">", name = "disk", color = "(BE)"}
```

* `disk_0` is always the **system drive**.
* To list all available disks:

```sh
catnap -g disks
```
