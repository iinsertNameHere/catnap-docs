# 🎨 Colors
Catnip's color system uses a ColorId, which is made up of the colors first and last letter, enclosed in characters that indicate the type of color.

**Color Types:**
- Foreground Normal  -> `(#)`
- Foreground Bright  -> `{#}`
- Background Normal -> `[#]`
- Background Bright -> `<#>`

> **NOTE:** `#` Should be replaced by the color id.

**Color IDs:**
- BLACK   -> `BK`
- RED     -> `RD`
- GREEN   -> `GN`
- YELLOW  -> `YW`
- BLUE    -> `BE`
- MAGENTA -> `MA`
- CYAN    -> `CN`
- WHITE   -> `WE`

So, for example: `{GN}` translates to `Foreground-Bright-Green`.

To set the color to Default, use `!DT!`.

>**Tip:**
>The colors are dependent on your terminal's colors.
